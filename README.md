## Summary
_This is a group project with nihuynh@42_
_Fillit is a project who let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming : searching for the optimal solution among a huge set of pos- sibilities. In this particular project, you will be charged of creating an algorithm which fits some Tetriminos together into the smallest possible square._
_A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure that most of you might knows thanks to the popular game Tetris._
